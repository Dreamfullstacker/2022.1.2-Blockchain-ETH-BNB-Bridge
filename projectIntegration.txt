combining projects

(bool sent, bytes memory data) = _to[i].call.value(currentVal/length)("");
line in ethSwap.sol is replaced with new code which is solidity version 
of the eth-bsc-transfer.js script in project2

Once this is done, the ethSwap contract wallet needs to be the admin for project 2 so that it can send bridge transaction with correct signature

Last is the project 2 tokens should be the same as Dapp token in project1
that way Ethswap can use its supply balance to interact with bridge.
